## Competition Analysis for Inspiration: BoxLunch 
(Solo Project) [Back To HomePage](./) / [Back to Projects Content Table](#projects-content-table)

**Project Overview:** 
This project analyzes BoxLunch as a source of inspiration, identifying key strategies that drive its success. By examining its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT), along with marketing efforts, consumer engagement, and store expansion, we gain valuable insights into best practices for brand growth. The analysis leverages web scraping, Google Trends, and manual data collection to ensure a comprehensive understanding of BoxLunchâ€™s market presence.

**Research Question:**
How do BoxLunch marketing strategies, including social media engagement, store growth, and employee satisfaction influence consumer behavior and enhance customer engagement?

**Data Collection Methods:**
To ensure comprehensive analysis, various data sources were utilized:
- **Reddit Data Extraction (asyncpraw API)** â€“ Retrieved consumer discussions and sentiment data from Reddit.
- **YouTube Scraping (Selenium WebDriver - Chrome)** â€“ Collected search query data to analyze BoxLunchâ€™s content strategy and engagement levels.
- **Google Trends** â€“ Identified shifts in consumer interest, pinpointing key seasonal trends and promotional effectiveness.
- **Manual Data Collection (Facebook Event Pages)** â€“ Tracked grand opening events to analyze store expansion.
- **Glassdoor & Indeed Ratings** â€“ Evaluated workplace culture and employee satisfaction to assess its impact on brand perception.

**Project Reflection:**
This analysis provided valuable insights into how BoxLunch engages its audience, expands its physical presence, and manages employee satisfaction to drive consumer loyalty. By combining data scraping, Google Trends analysis, and manual tracking, we identified key marketing strategies that contribute to the brandâ€™s success. The study highlights the effectiveness of exclusive products, influencer marketing, and community engagement in fostering strong customer relationships. These findings offer inspiration for refining marketing approaches in similar industries.

**Self Reflection:**
The BoxLunch Competition Analysis for Inspiration was my first project at Cooledture. Although this was a solo project, I was lucky to have a supportive team that guided me through the process and helped me stay focused on my research question, specifically identifying what types of data would be most relevant. During this project, I learned how to scrape data using Selenium WebDriver and Python Reddit API Wrapper to collect the data I needed to better understand BoxLunch. Additionally, I used Google Trends for the first time to track shifts in consumer interest, and I conducted research to uncover the reasons behind the spikes and dips in interest.

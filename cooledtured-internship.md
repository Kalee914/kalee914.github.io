### My Experience at Cooledtured

[Skip to Projects Content Table](#projects-content-table)

I've been with Cooledtured Collection since October 2024, initially joining as a Data Research Analyst intern for a three-month program. However, I chose to stay because of the connections I built with my peers and stakeholders and the opportunity to take on higher-level projects that challenged me to grow technically and professionally.

Over time, I transitioned into a role focused on system architecture, data engineering, and automation. I took on projects that involved designing and implementing data pipelines, managing infrastructure, and developing solutions to make workflows smoother. I also worked on optimizing processes and automating tasks, making our team more efficient. Each challenge I faced contributed to my growth, and every project taught me something valuable.

To me, Cooledtured has always felt like more than just a workplace. Itâ€™s a supportive community where we all learn from each other. Our twice-weekly QA meetings with my team and leader create space for continuous growth and the monthly Town Hall meetings give us a chance to connect with interns from other teams, share ideas, and find new opportunities to collaborate. Outside of these required meetings, my teammates and I would meet to discuss planning and brainstorm ideas, which has made our collaboration even stronger.

Throughout my time here, Iâ€™ve mainly used Google Apps Script and Python to build efficient solutions, Google Sheets Query functions for dynamic data manipulation, and real-time reports. For data analysis, I've used R and for visual storytelling and data visualization, Iâ€™ve worked with ggplot2, Tableau, Genially, Figma, and Lucidchart to present complex data in a clear, engaging, and accessible. I created interactive infographics with Genially and Figma and used Lucidchart for flowcharts and process diagrams.Additionally, I built a user-friendly landing page and analysis dashboard using Google Sites to ensure easy access to information.

Being part of Cooledtured has not only strengthened my technical skills but also helped me grow personally and professionally in meaningful ways.

Thank you for reading! Please feel free to check out my project content table and choose which project you'd like to explore. Some of my projects are already completed, but I havenâ€™t uploaded them yet as Iâ€™m currently focused on projects in progress. Iâ€™ll be updating the table soon. However, some projects also have links to my presentation videos, so feel free to check those out first.

## Competition Analysis for Inspiration: BoxLunch 
(Solo Project) 

**Project Overview:** 
This project analyzes BoxLunch as a source of inspiration, identifying key strategies that drive its success. By examining its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT), along with marketing efforts, consumer engagement, and store expansion, we gain valuable insights into best practices for brand growth. The analysis leverages web scraping, Google Trends, and manual data collection to ensure a comprehensive understanding of BoxLunchâ€™s market presence.

**Research Question:**
How do BoxLunch marketing strategies, including social media engagement, store growth, and employee satisfaction influence consumer behavior and enhance customer engagement?

**Data Collection Methods:**
To ensure comprehensive analysis, various data sources were utilized:
- **Reddit Data Extraction (asyncpraw API)** â€“ Retrieved consumer discussions and sentiment data from Reddit.
- **YouTube Scraping (Selenium WebDriver - Chrome)** â€“ Collected search query data to analyze BoxLunchâ€™s content strategy and engagement levels.
- **Google Trends** â€“ Identified shifts in consumer interest, pinpointing key seasonal trends and promotional effectiveness.
- **Manual Data Collection (Facebook Event Pages)** â€“ Tracked grand opening events to analyze store expansion.
- **Glassdoor & Indeed Ratings** â€“ Evaluated workplace culture and employee satisfaction to assess its impact on brand perception.

**Project Reflection:**
This analysis provided valuable insights into how BoxLunch engages its audience, expands its physical presence, and manages employee satisfaction to drive consumer loyalty. By combining data scraping, Google Trends analysis, and manual tracking, we identified key marketing strategies that contribute to the brandâ€™s success. The study highlights the effectiveness of exclusive products, influencer marketing, and community engagement in fostering strong customer relationships. These findings offer inspiration for refining marketing approaches in similar industries.

**Self Reflection:**
The BoxLunch Competition Analysis for Inspiration was my first project at Cooledture. Although this was a Solo Project, I was lucky to have a supportive team that guided me through the process and helped me stay focused on my research question, specifically identifying what types of data would be most relevant. During this project, I learned how to scrape data using Selenium WebDriver and Python Reddit API Wrapper to collect the data I needed to better understand BoxLunch. Additionally, I used Google Trends for the first time to track shifts in consumer interest, and I conducted research to uncover the reasons behind the spikes and dips in interest.

## Social Media Insight and Content Analysis
(Team Project) 

**Description:** 
This project focused on analyzing Instagram content from **2021 to 2024**. The goal was to understand what types of posts performed best and how engagement varied across different content formats. Our main research questions were:

- **Which posts or content types perform best?**
- **What is the engagement rate** (likes, comments, shares, saves) **for each content type?**
- **How could data from Instagram Insights help improve content formatting and delivery?**

In addition to our data, we analyzed **eight competitor companies** to learn about their background, growth strategies, and social media performance.

We used these insights to make actionable suggestions to help the content team improve their formatting and content delivery.

**Project Reflection:**
Throughout the project, we saw the importance of clearly defined research questions and aligning them with the available data. While Instagram Insights offered valuable metrics, the data lacked the level of detail we needed for deeper analysis. As a result, we manually reviewed and classified each post by content type to ensure more accurate and relevant insights.

One improvement we identified was updating the content teamâ€™s submission process. By adjusting the format to align with engagement metrics provided by Instagram, we can create a more complete dataset in the future. This will help support ongoing performance tracking and enable more meaningful analysis over time.

**Self Reflection:**
This project taught me how bridge the gap between quantitative data and qualitative content insights. I realized that numbers alone donâ€™t tell the full story - context, sentiment, and strategy play a huge role in audience engagement.

When we saw the limitations of the existing data, I took the initiative to suggest a change to the content submission format so that future data could be more easily linked to performance metrics. It felt great to contribute something that could make a long-term impact on how we track and improve content.

Overall, this experience strengthened my analytical thinking, attention to detail, and ability to connect data with real-world applications.

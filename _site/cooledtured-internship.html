<h2 id="welcome-to-my-cooledtured-internship-projects-overview">Welcome to My Cooledtured-internship projects overview</h2>

<h3 id="my-experience-at-cooledtured">My Experience at Cooledtured</h3>

<p>Iâ€™ve been with Cooledtured Collection since October 2024, initially joining as a Data Research Analyst intern for a three-month program. However, I chose to stay because of the connections I built with my peers and stakeholders and the opportunity to take on higher-level projects that challenged me to grow both technically and professionally.</p>

<p>Over time, I transitioned into a role focused on system architecture, data engineering, and automation. I took on projects that involved designing and implementing data pipelines, managing infrastructure, and developing solutions to make workflows smoother. I also worked on optimizing processes and automating tasks, making our team more efficient. Each challenge I faced contributed to my growth, and every project taught me something valuable.</p>

<p>To me, Cooledtured has always felt like more than just a workplace. Itâ€™s a supportive community where we all learn from each other. Our twice-weekly QA meetings with my team and leader create space for continuous growth and the monthly Town Hall meetings give us a chance to connect with interns from other teams, share ideas, and find new opportunities to collaborate. Outside of these required meetings, my teammates and I would meet to discuss planning and brainstorm ideas, which has made our collaboration even stronger.</p>

<p>Throughout my time here, Iâ€™ve mainly used Google Apps Script and Python to build efficient solutions, Google Sheets Query functions for dynamic data manipulation, making it easier to generate real-time reports and R for data analysis. For visualizing insights, Iâ€™ve worked with ggplot2, Tableau, Genially, Figma, and Lucidchart ensuring complex data is presented in a clear, engaging, and accessible way for stakeholders. Additionally, I built a landing page and an analysis dashboard using Google Sites, keeping the design simple and user-friendly. I wanted to make sure it was easy to navigate and that people could quickly find the information they needed.</p>

<p>Being part of Cooledtured has not only strengthened my technical skills but also helped me grow personally and professionally in meaningful ways.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading! Please feel free to check out my project content table and choose which project youâ€™d like to explore. Some of my projects are already completed, but I havenâ€™t uploaded them yet as Iâ€™m currently focused on projects in progress. Iâ€™ll be updating the table soon. However, some projects also have links to my presentation videos, so feel free to check those out first.</p>

<h2 id="competition-analysis-for-inspiration-boxlunch">Competition Analysis for Inspiration: BoxLunch</h2>
<p>(Solo Project)</p>

<p><strong>Project Overview:</strong> 
This project analyzes BoxLunch as a source of inspiration, identifying key strategies that drive its success. By examining its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT), along with marketing efforts, consumer engagement, and store expansion, we gain valuable insights into best practices for brand growth. The analysis leverages web scraping, Google Trends, and manual data collection to ensure a comprehensive understanding of BoxLunchâ€™s market presence.</p>

<p><strong>Research Question:</strong>
How do BoxLunch marketing strategies, including social media engagement, store growth, and employee satisfaction influence consumer behavior and enhance customer engagement?</p>

<p><strong>Data Collection Methods:</strong>
To ensure comprehensive analysis, various data sources were utilized:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Reddit Data Extraction (asyncpraw API)</strong> â€“ Retrieved consumer discussions and sentiment data from Reddit.</li>
  <li><strong>YouTube Scraping (Selenium WebDriver - Chrome)</strong> â€“ Collected search query data to analyze BoxLunchâ€™s content strategy and engagement levels.</li>
  <li><strong>Google Trends</strong> â€“ Identified shifts in consumer interest, pinpointing key seasonal trends and promotional effectiveness.</li>
  <li><strong>Manual Data Collection (Facebook Event Pages)</strong> â€“ Tracked grand opening events to analyze store expansion.</li>
  <li><strong>Glassdoor &amp; Indeed Ratings</strong> â€“ Evaluated workplace culture and employee satisfaction to assess its impact on brand perception.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Project Reflection:</strong>
This analysis provided valuable insights into how BoxLunch engages its audience, expands its physical presence, and manages employee satisfaction to drive consumer loyalty. By combining data scraping, Google Trends analysis, and manual tracking, we identified key marketing strategies that contribute to the brandâ€™s success. The study highlights the effectiveness of exclusive products, influencer marketing, and community engagement in fostering strong customer relationships. These findings offer inspiration for refining marketing approaches in similar industries.</p>

<p><strong>Self Reflection:</strong>
The BoxLunch Competition Analysis for Inspiration was my first project at Cooledture. Although this was a solo project, I was lucky to have a supportive team that guided me through the process and helped me stay focused on my research question, specifically identifying what types of data would be most relevant. During this project, I learned how to scrape data using Selenium WebDriver and Python Reddit API Wrapper to collect the data I needed to better understand BoxLunch. Additionally, I used Google Trends for the first time to track shifts in consumer interest, and I conducted research to uncover the reasons behind the spikes and dips in interest.</p>

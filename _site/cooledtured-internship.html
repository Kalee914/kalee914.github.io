<h3 id="my-experience-at-cooledtured">My Experience at Cooledtured</h3>

<p><a href="#projects-content-table">Skip to Projects Content Table</a></p>

<p>I’ve been with Cooledtured Collection since October 2024, initially joining as a Data Research Analyst intern for a three-month program. However, I chose to stay because of the connections I built with my peers and stakeholders and the opportunity to take on higher-level projects that challenged me to grow technically and professionally.</p>

<p>Over time, I transitioned into a role focused on system architecture, data engineering, and automation. I took on projects that involved designing and implementing data pipelines, managing infrastructure, and developing solutions to make workflows smoother. I also worked on optimizing processes and automating tasks, making our team more efficient. Each challenge I faced contributed to my growth, and every project taught me something valuable.</p>

<p>To me, Cooledtured has always felt like more than just a workplace. It’s a supportive community where we all learn from each other. Our twice-weekly QA meetings with my team and leader create space for continuous growth and the monthly Town Hall meetings give us a chance to connect with interns from other teams, share ideas, and find new opportunities to collaborate. Outside of these required meetings, my teammates and I would meet to discuss planning and brainstorm ideas, which has made our collaboration even stronger.</p>

<p>Throughout my time here, I’ve mainly used Google Apps Script and Python to build efficient solutions, Google Sheets Query functions for dynamic data manipulation, and real-time reports. For data analysis, I’ve used R and for visual storytelling and data visualization, I’ve worked with ggplot2, Tableau, Genially, Figma, and Lucidchart to present complex data in a clear, engaging, and accessible. I created interactive infographics with Genially and Figma and used Lucidchart for flowcharts and process diagrams.Additionally, I built a user-friendly landing page and analysis dashboard using Google Sites to ensure easy access to information.</p>

<p>Being part of Cooledtured has not only strengthened my technical skills but also helped me grow personally and professionally in meaningful ways.</p>

<h2 id="social-media-insight-and-content-analysis">Social Media Insight and Content Analysis</h2>
<p>(Team Project)</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> 
This project focused on analyzing Instagram content from <strong>2021 to 2024</strong>. The goal was to understand what types of posts performed best and how engagement varied across different content formats. Our main research questions were:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Which posts or content types perform best?</strong></li>
  <li><strong>What is the engagement rate</strong> (likes, comments, shares, saves) <strong>for each content type?</strong></li>
  <li><strong>How could data from Instagram Insights help improve content formatting and delivery?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to our data, we analyzed <strong>eight competitor companies</strong> to learn about their background, growth strategies, and social media performance.</p>

<p>We used these insights to make actionable suggestions to help the content team improve their formatting and content delivery.</p>

<p><strong>Project Reflection:</strong>
Throughout the project, we saw the importance of clearly defined research questions and aligning them with the available data. While Instagram Insights offered valuable metrics, the data lacked the level of detail we needed for deeper analysis. As a result, we manually reviewed and classified each post by content type to ensure more accurate and relevant insights.</p>

<p>One improvement we identified was updating the content team’s submission process. By adjusting the format to align with engagement metrics provided by Instagram, we can create a more complete dataset in the future. This will help support ongoing performance tracking and enable more meaningful analysis over time.</p>

<p><strong>Self Reflection:</strong>
This project taught me how bridge the gap between quantitative data and qualitative content insights. I realized that numbers alone don’t tell the full story - context, sentiment, and strategy play a huge role in audience engagement.</p>

<p>When we saw the limitations of the existing data, I took the initiative to suggest a change to the content submission format so that future data could be more easily linked to performance metrics. It felt great to contribute something that could make a long-term impact on how we track and improve content.</p>

<p>Overall, this experience strengthened my analytical thinking, attention to detail, and ability to connect data with real-world applications.</p>

<h2 id="automated-content-elt-pipeline">Automated Content ELT Pipeline</h2>
<p>(Solo Project)</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong>
The Automated Content ELT Pipeline project aimed to improve the data collection, processing, and analysis for the content creation team. We transitioned from Google Docs to Google Forms for content submissions, enabling easier data export as CSV files. The pipeline extracts, loads, and transforms the data, linking creators to their content via unique IDs and connecting with social media metrics. This setup facilitates detailed content and performance analysis, supports creating visual progress reports for creators, and helps identify platform effectiveness for various content types. T</p>

<p><strong>Security</strong>
The entire pipeline is automated using App Script, running updates every 10 minutes while securely protecting private information by anonymizing creators with unique IDs. Additionally, the sheets are restricted throughout the entire ELT process (extracting, transforming, and loading) to prevent unauthorized access.</p>

<p><strong>Project Reflection:</strong>
Initially, the available data was limited and inconsistently formatted, necessitating the manual classification of posts by genre, content, and style to establish a reliable baseline. This project successfully addressed these challenges by restructuring data collection and processing methods. Transitioning from Google Docs to Google Forms and building an automated ELT pipeline enabled more accurate, unbiased, and in-depth analysis. Standardizing column names, removing duplicates, and validating data greatly improved overall data quality. The pipeline’s design supports continuous updates, protects sensitive information, and creates opportunities for future projects that combine qualitative and quantitative data to yield richer insights. Ultimately, the project optimized data workflows and laid a strong foundation for Cooledtured to use data as a strategic asset for growth and industry leadership.</p>

<p><strong>Self Reflection:</strong>
Working on the Automated Content ELT Pipeline has deepened my technical skills in data engineering, automation, and data quality management. I gained hands-on experience designing a system that balances data accessibility with privacy, ensuring creators’ information remains secure while enabling powerful analytics. Troubleshooting inconsistencies during the transformation phase strengthened my problem-solving abilities and attention to detail. I also developed a stronger understanding of how structured data pipelines can directly impact business insights and strategic decisions. This project has increased my confidence in managing end-to-end data workflows and envisioning long-term value for data-driven initiatives.</p>

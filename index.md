## _Volunteer Experience_  

I've been with Cooledtured Collection since October 2024, started as a Data Research Analyst intern. Overtime, I transitioned to focus on system architecture, data engineering, process optimization, and automation. I began designing and implementing data pipelines, managing data infrastructure, and developing technical solutions to improve workflows. Additionally, I worked on optimizing processes and automating tasks to enhance team efficiency.

To learn more about my experience with Cooledtured Collection, feel free to check out my [Internship – Cooledtured Collection](./cooledtured-internship.html) page.

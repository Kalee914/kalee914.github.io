# Kalee's E-Portfolio

## Introduction
[Skip to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Hi, my name is Kalee—welcome to my website! I am a Junior Data Engineer, Solution Engineer, and Analyst with a strong foundation in data analysis, database management, and programming, along with a Computer Science degree. My expertise includes analyzing data, conducting research, and generating insights through various data management techniques and visualization methods. I focus on working with relational and non-relational databases, automating data processes, and creating efficient workflows to support informed decision-making. 

I also have experience designing and implementing solutions to improve workflows and solve complex problems. I optimize data pipelines, automate workflows, and apply data-driven strategies to enhance user experiences. Whether extracting valuable trends, designing efficient ETL processes, or creating compelling visualizations, I aim to make complex data accessible and actionable.  

Feel free to explore my projects on this website (E-Portfolio), check out my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/Kalee914), or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kalee-l-566433184/)!
